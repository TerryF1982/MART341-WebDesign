Art Website

I have decided to create a artistic website that includes all aspects of the work I have done and will do going forward.  I decided to do this on because it is more inclusive then just a photo website.  It will also be more useful then an adventure website.

I also want to keep this website professional but with a touch of playful artistry to add a personal touch to it. 

Reflections

1. Balance has not really become a factor at this moment for the website.  I think that will come more into play as I add photographs, ect.

2. The initial idea was to have a homepage that links to the genre of different art.  I think i stuck with that for the most part.  I think just a vertical balance does not work well but will have to incorporate a balance horizontally as well.

3. I did not experiment with float and margin this week.
4. The main challenge I feel is decided where to place things throught the page.  I also dont feel like there was enough information this week to add a horizontal balance to the page.
