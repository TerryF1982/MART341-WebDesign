## redo of Assignment 3 due to lack of assignment 4 website being accurate.

I understood the topics and had to **delete** these it all becuase I thought there was something wrong with my github or repository becuase week 4 instructions were not accurate or even proofread before posting to the class website.  So now I have to do the work twice becuase of a **failure** on the *instructions* side of this class.
