                I am a non-traditional student at the <a href="https://www.umt.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #70002e;">University of Montana</a>. I am working toward both bachelor’s degrees in Art as well as another in Media Arts. I am currently a Junior (Fall 2024). I have a passion for the outdoors and spend my free time in the summer fly fishing around western Montana. I was born in Montana and grew up in a small town in central Montana. Despite starting in a small town, I have been around the world twice and have also lived all over the United States, from as far north as Prudhoe Bay, Alaska to the deep south in places like Louisiana and Georgia. Although my life and travels have taken me all over, Montana will always be home to me.

            <p>
                As a veteran with multiple combat deployments, transitioning to civilian life was a long and difficult journey. After leaving the military, I isolated myself in remote oilfields, avoiding crowds and the expectations of a society I felt disconnected from. Instead of seeking therapy for my PTSD, I buried myself in work and isolation, struggling to forget the things I had seen and done. This approach, while a survival mechanism, left me haunted by my past.
                Everything changed when I discovered art. Creating art provided a personal and therapeutic outlet. The canvas became a space for expression without the need for justification.
                Art is not just about creating beauty; it symbolizes survival, reflection, and growth. It helps me reclaim parts of myself lost as a young paratrooper.<span style="color: #ffcc00;"> Pursuing art now, at this stage in my life, feels like the culmination of a long and difficult journey—and one that is far from over.</span>
