# Final Project: [Your Website Title]

## Overview
This project showcases the skills I've learned throughout the semester in web development. For my final project, I created a website for My art work.
## Project Structure
- **index.html** - The homepage of the website.
- **about.html** - A page providing information about the website or business.
- **contact.html** - A page containing contact information or a contact form.
- **style.css** - External stylesheet for styling the website.
- **images/** - Folder containing all images used on the website.
- **README.md** - This file containing the project information and details.

## Features
1. **Responsive Design**: The website adjusts to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
2. **Navigation**: The website includes a simple and intuitive navigation system with links to all the main pages (Home, About, Contact).
3. **Embedded Media**: Included an embedded video/audio file on the [page name] for interactive content.
4. **Contact Form**: A form on the Contact page allows users to reach out directly.
5. **Visual Design**: The site uses a clean and cohesive color scheme and font choices to enhance readability and aesthetics.

## How I Implemented Key Techniques

### 1. **External Stylesheet**
   - I used an external CSS file (style.css) to separate content from presentation. This makes the site easier to maintain and allows for consistent styling across pages.

### 2. **Fonts**
   - I applied the font 'Trebuchet MS' for a clean and modern look. I also utilized Google Fonts for additional typography if required.

### 3. **Images**
   - I used images from [source] to visually enhance the site. All images are optimized for web performance to ensure fast load times.

### 4. **Embedded Media**
   - For the embedded media, I used [insert media type, e.g., YouTube video, audio player, Google Maps]. This enriches the user's experience and adds interactive elements to the site.

### 5. **Semantic HTML**
   - I ensured that my HTML markup was semantic, meaning that I used proper tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>`. This improves accessibility and SEO.

### 6. **Responsive Design**
   - I used media queries in the CSS to ensure that the website looks good on all devices, whether viewed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
