Use of elements

I use the DIV attribute to create sections that contain both text and image elements.  This helps organize the page into sections.

I use the SPAN attribute to highlight and emphasize key texts in each section.

I use the IFRAME attribute to contain the VIDEO element.  The video does not contain audio as that is how I created the video becuase for my purposes sound was not needed.  

However I use the AUDIO attribute for purpose of the assignment to add a file to play 

I use the CLASS attribute to apply CSS styling to the text/image sections.

I use the escape character in the footer for the copyright section.

I also used a couple images from the web in the navagaion section.  First a "home" button. and then an underconstruction symbol to allow for a logo that I have not finished yet.  

I final thought is Im thinking about making this the home page for my website as I continue to develop it past the assignments.
