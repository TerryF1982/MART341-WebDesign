Techniques Used This Week

Div: I used <div> elements to create distinct sections on my page, such as the introduction and art sections. This helped organize the layout and provided a framework for future pages. For instance, the introduction section includes a <div> for the image and another for the text content, allowing for flexible styling and positioning.
Span: I implemented <span> elements to add captions to images within the image containers. This technique enabled me to style the captions separately from the images and maintain a clean, organized look. I used spans for the hover captions, enhancing user interaction.
Audio: I incorporated an <audio> element by randomly selecting an audio file as I currently dont feel this is necessary on my page but was required for assignment.
Video: I utilized an <iframe> to embed a video that showcases my art the video is one I quickly created for the assignment and removed the sound as it was awful and mostly power tools running in the background. This is a temporary solution as i do need to create some better videos of my sculptures.  I think this will eventually end up on the sculptures page.  
Iframe: The <iframe> is specifically used to embed the YouTube video. This allows visitors to watch the video without leaving the page, keeping the experience seamless and cohesive. 
Class: I used the class attribute multiple times throughout my code to apply specific styles to different sections. For example, I created classes for the .nav-header, .introduction-section, and .media-section, allowing me to manage styles efficiently and consistently across various elements.
Escape Character: I employed an escape character in my HTML code when referencing the University of Montana website with an ampersand in the URL. This ensures that the character is displayed correctly in the browser, preventing any issues with rendering.



Reflections:  I think this format will well for most of the pages.  I may actually start using this as the index.html as it more refined for a home page.  I have used a couple place holders for different things.  The under construction was used in place of a logo that I have yet to complete.  I am also not complety happy with the "home" button.  Color choices are still a work in progress as I pick one and change the page then they dont work together.  So I am realizing color choices for things such as navagation header and footer may be the last element to perfect.
