##Asignment 10

- This week, I am working on the **sculpture.html** page.

## Required Techniques 

- **External CSS Style Sheet**: 
  I created an external CSS file named `styles.css`

- **Class Selector**: 
  I used class selectors to style multiple elements with similar characteristics.

- **ID Selector**:
  I applied an ID selector to the header element for specific styling.

## Selected Additional Techniques

1. **Different Background Colors**:
   Each section of the page features a transparent background color to allow the page background texture to be seen

   I applied various font colors to headings and paragraphs to enhance readability and aesthetic appeal, attempting to use good contrast against the background.

2. **Text Alignment**:
   Text alignment was used to center section headings.

3. **Positioning**:
   I utilized relative and absolute positioning for certain elements, allowing for more control over layout and spacing.

4. **Borders**:
   Borders werent added but a shadow effect was to help visually seperate containers
