Reflections

I am liking how this is coming along.  I have decided to keep all the pages included in this assignment file to keep all the links working correctly.
Some of the mistakes I am making as I write the code are hard to find but I am finding there is lots of resources online that can help find whats going wrong.


I like the fact that I can keep addressing little things as I go and dont have to start from scratch.  The further I get into this page the more I find I dont like how something is looking or working and its easy to correct.
