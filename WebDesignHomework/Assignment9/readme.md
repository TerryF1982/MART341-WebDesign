# Week 9 Assignment

## Home Page (index.html)

I worked on my home page `index.html` to build a color scheme and changed the navigation header to a more prominent title. I also moved the links down below. I used some placeholder images I found for the links to the other pages.

## Photography Page

I also worked on a photography page with the same format, creating categories for the photos I want to display. I used placeholders as I dig through my photos and find the right ones. However, I did add a couple of photos I have used in this class so far.

## Paintings Page

Finally, I started my paintings page with a couple of pictures of my paintings. I also included a walkthrough section for my next painting. Unfortunately, I don't have the images to display, so it’s hard to know the exact captions to use. However, the format is here and will make for easy editing as I continue and get the painting started. I also added clickable links at the bottom of the materials section. Again, I haven’t started painting yet, so I can’t accurately list what was used. I plan to format this in an ordered list manner when the time comes.

## Future Plans

I think I will create the sculpture page to mimic the painting page with a step-by-step guide for one of my projects. I also need to develop an actual contact page that I want to use, and a drawing page that will probably be a lot simpler than the painting page, as I don’t feel the need for another "how-to" section.
