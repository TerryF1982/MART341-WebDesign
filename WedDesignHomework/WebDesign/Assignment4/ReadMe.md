**1. How do Web browsers function?**
    Web browsers function begins when the user enters a URL into the browser window.  The browser then  sends a request over the network to a server.  The server then sends information to the browser in response.  The browser then using a rendering engine will display the information (html and css documents) as a web page. The rendering engine is responsible for applying the structure of the page as well as colors. 

**2. What is the DOM and how does it power your web page?**
